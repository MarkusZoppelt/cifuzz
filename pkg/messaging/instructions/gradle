To use CI Fuzz and its dependencies, you have to configure access to the CI repository
and add the CI Fuzz Gradle plugin to your project or subproject.

For this, add the following repository credentials to Gradle, e.g. to your ~/.gradle/gradle.properties file.

    CodeIntelligenceRepositoryUsername=<YOUR_USERNAME>
    CodeIntelligenceRepositoryPassword=<YOUR_TOKEN>

You can access your username and private token on the CI Download Portal Configuration page at https://downloads.code-intelligence.com/client.

To be able to access the plugin, add the CI repository as a plugin repository to your project's settings.gradle:

    pluginManagement {
      repositories {
        maven {
          name "CodeIntelligenceRepository"
          url "https://gitlab.code-intelligence.com/api/v4/projects/89/packages/maven"
          credentials(PasswordCredentials.class)
          content {
            includeGroupByRegex("com\\.code-intelligence.*")
          }
        }
        gradlePluginPortal()
      }
    }

To resolve CI Fuzz dependencies, also add the CI repository in your project's or subproject's build.gradle:

    repositories {
      maven {
        name "CodeIntelligenceRepository"
        url "https://gitlab.code-intelligence.com/api/v4/projects/89/packages/maven"
        credentials(PasswordCredentials.class)
        content {
          includeGroupByRegex("com\\.code-intelligence.*")
        }
      }
      mavenCentral()
    }

Finally, add the CI Fuzz Gradle plugin to your build.gradle to enable fuzz testing:

    plugins {
      id "com.code-intelligence.cifuzz" version "1.12.0"
    }

Fuzz tests are executed with JUnit 5. If it is not already set up, the plugin will automatically add the required dependencies and configuration to your project.
